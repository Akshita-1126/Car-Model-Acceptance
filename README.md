# Car-Model-Acceptance
## An Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning based classification model.
It is an AIML-based project to classify the car modelâ€™s data including its features. Different 
classification algorithms are applied to the CSV like Logistic Regression, KNN, Support vector 
machine, and decision tree 
Language used- Python

## What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.

## What is KNN?
K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.

## What is Support vector machine?
Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

## What is Decision tree?
Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.
